# Weather-Dash

This week we learned about third party APIs and how to utalize them for our websites. Using JavaScript and APIs to pull data the website can show a user current weather and a 5 day forcast. Also utalizing local storage it will save past city searches to the page so if a user is traveling and wants to check weather in a area it will still show.

** How To Use**

Weather can be searched but entering a valid city name in the search bar. Upon entering, a current weather and 5 day forecast will populate on the page. The info provided will show temp, humidity, wind speed, and UV.
